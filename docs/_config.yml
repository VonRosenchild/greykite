  Greykite is a fast and flexible forecasting library developed by LinkedIn.
  The library provides exploratory data analysis (EDA), model pipeline,
  model benchmarking, etc. With the pipeline you can do transformation,
  grid search and cross-validation, model evaluation and plotting.
  The core algorithm, named Silverkite, uses feature engineering and
  various machine learning algorithms to fit the time series model.
  The algorithm comes with many popular time features,
  such as seasonality fourier series and holiday indicators,
  to be used as regressors.
  Moreover, you can freely create any features that are related to the time series,
  and use them to fit the machine learning model of your choice.
